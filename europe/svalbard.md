## Introduction

### Background
Norse explorers may have first discovered the Svalbard archipelago in the 12th century. The islands served as an international whaling base during the 17th and 18th centuries. Norway's sovereignty was internationally recognized by treaty in 1920, and five years later Norway officially took over the territory. Coal mining started in the 20th century, and a Norwegian company and a Russian company are still in operation today. Travel between the settlements is accomplished with snowmobiles, aircraft, and boats.

## Geography

- `total`: 0 km

### Coastline
3,587 km

### Maritime claims
- `territorial sea`: 12 nm
- `contiguous zone`: 24 nm
- `continental shelf`: extends to depth of exploitation
- `exclusive fishing zone`: 200 nm

### Climate
arctic, tempered by warm North Atlantic Current; cool summers, cold winters; North Atlantic Current flows along west and north coasts of Spitsbergen, keeping water open and navigable most of the year

### Natural resources
coal, iron ore, copper, zinc, phosphate, wildlife, fish

### Land use
- `agricultural land`: 0% (2018 est.)
- `other`: 100% (2018 est.)

### Population distribution
the small population is primarily concentrated on the island of Spitsbergen in a handful of settlements on the south side of the Isfjorden, with Longyearbyen being the largest

### Natural hazards
ice floes often block the entrance to Bellsund (a transit point for coal export) on the west coast and occasionally make parts of the northeastern coast inaccessible to maritime traffic

### Geography - note
northernmost part of the Kingdom of Norway; consists of nine main islands; glaciers and snowfields cover 60% of the total area; Spitsbergen Island is the site of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a seed repository established by the Global Crop Diversity Trust and the Norwegian Government

## Environment

### Environment - current issues
ice floes are a maritime hazard; past exploitation of mammal species (whale, seal, walrus, and polar bear) severely depleted the populations, but a gradual recovery seems to be occurring

### Climate
arctic, tempered by warm North Atlantic Current; cool summers, cold winters; North Atlantic Current flows along west and north coasts of Spitsbergen, keeping water open and navigable most of the year

### Land use
- `agricultural land`: 0% (2018 est.)
- `other`: 100% (2018 est.)

## Government

### Country name
